Google's PageRank algorithm, developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is designed to guide users to the most relevant and authoritative content in the internet. We have billions of webpages in the internet. It is highly possible that a webpage has a link to another webpage. For example, if we search "apple" in Google, there is around 12 billion results. This is an example of how Google links to other webpages. Pagerank assigns a numerical value to each page based on the quantity and quality of links pointing to it, determining its importance within the web ecosystem. This algorithm forms the backbone of Google's search engine, ensuring users receive the most relevant and authoritative results to their queries. In this Skills Project, we will implement the Google's Pagerank algorithm in Sage.
